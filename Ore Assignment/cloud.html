<b>Features:</b>
<p><u>Scale-out workloads (T2D)</u>
<br>- T2D offers the best price-performance compared to general-purpose VMs from any of the leading public cloud vendors. It is the first instance type in the Tau VM family and comes in predefined shapes, with up to 60vCPUs per VM and 4GB of memory per vCPU. T2D is ideal for scale-out workloads like web servers, containerized microservices, media transcoding, and large scale java applications.</p>
<p><u>General purpose workloads (E2, N2, N2D, N1)</u>
<br>- E2, N2, N2D, and N1 are general-purpose machines offering a good balance of price and performance, and are suitable for a wide variety of common workloads including databases, development and testing environments, web applications, and mobile gaming.</p>
<p><u>Ultra-high memory (M2, M1)</u>
<br>- Offers the highest memory configurations with up to 12 TB for a single instance. They are well suited to memory-intensive workloads such as large in-memory databases like SAP HANA, and in-memory data analytics workloads.</p>
<p><u>Most demanding applications and workloads (A2)</u>
<br>- Accelerator-optimized machines are based on the NVIDIA Ampere A100 Tensor Core GPU. Each A100 GPU offers up to 20x the compute performance compared to the previous generation GPU. These VMs are designed for your most demanding workloads such as machine learning and high performance computing.</p>
